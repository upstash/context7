When you're unsure about a library's API, syntax, configuration, or behavior, use Context7 to fetch current documentation rather than guessing from training data that may be outdated.

Use Context7 when:
- You're not confident about the exact API or syntax for a library
- The user asks about a specific version (e.g., "Next.js 15", "React 19")
- The library or framework has had recent major changes
- You need accurate code examples for a specific use case

You don't need to use Context7 for:
- Well-established language features (e.g., JavaScript array methods, Python builtins)
- Conversations where the user has already provided the relevant code or docs

See the `context7-docs-lookup` skill for detailed instructions on how to resolve libraries and fetch documentation.
