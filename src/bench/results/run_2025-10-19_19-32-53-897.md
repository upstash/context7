### 1. Next.js

**Question**: How do I create a dynamic route in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 88.50/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 82/100
  - The context clearly explains dynamic routes using the Pages Router: correct file naming with [param].js, a working code example with useRouter/router.query, how to access the route, and mentions data fetching. It’s practical and directly answers the question. However, it omits key nuances: (1) for static generation in the Pages Router you typically need getStaticPaths alongside getStaticProps; (2) it doesn’t cover the App Router approach (app/[param]/page.js, useParams/generateStaticParams), despite linking to App Router docs; and (3) no mention of catch-all/optional routes. Still, it’s largely helpful for many common cases.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides excellent, comprehensive coverage for answering the question about creating dynamic routes in Next.js. It includes: (1) Clear explanation of the file naming convention using brackets, (2) A complete, practical code example showing how to access dynamic parameters using useRouter, (3) Instructions on how to access the route, (4) Mention of data fetching options (getStaticProps/getServerSideProps), and (5) A link to official documentation for further learning. The only minor limitation is that it focuses on the Pages Router approach and doesn't mention the newer App Router approach, but the information provided is accurate and directly answers the question with actionable steps and working code.

#### Context:

```
To create a dynamic route in Next.js, you can follow these steps:

1. **File Naming Convention:**
   - Create a file in the `pages` directory with brackets around the dynamic segment. For example, to create a dynamic route for a user profile, create a file named `[username].js` inside the `pages` directory.

2. **Code Example:**
   ```javascript
   // pages/[username].js
   import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

   const UserProfile = () => {
     const router = useRouter();
     const { username } = router.query; // Get the dynamic segment

     return <div>User Profile: {username}</div>;
   };

   export default UserProfile;
   ```

3. **Accessing the Route:**
   - You can now access the route by navigating to `/john` in the browser, where `john` will be replaced by the value of `username`.

4. **Optional: Fetching Data:**
   - You can use Next.js's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` to fetch data based on the dynamic route.

### 2. Next.js

**Question**: How do I implement server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 84.00/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 83/100
  - The context gives a clear, actionable walkthrough with a working getServerSideProps example for the Pages Router, which directly answers how to implement SSR with data fetching. It also notes benefits and links to docs. However, it doesn’t cover the App Router approach (where getServerSideProps is not used), omits nuances like caching/revalidation and error handling, and the documentation link points to App Router content that may not match the provided example, which could cause confusion.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 85/100
  - The context provides a comprehensive and practical answer to the question about implementing server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js. It includes: (1) A clear step-by-step guide with numbered instructions, (2) A complete, working code example using getServerSideProps, (3) Explanation of the benefits of SSR (SEO and performance), and (4) A reference to official documentation for further learning. The context is directly relevant and actionable. The score is not 100 because: (1) It acknowledges that specific documentation retrieval failed, suggesting the response is based on general knowledge rather than current docs, (2) It only covers the Pages Router approach (getServerSideProps) and doesn't mention the newer App Router approach which is now recommended in Next.js 13+, and (3) It could include more advanced topics like error handling, caching strategies, or TypeScript examples. Nevertheless, it provides sufficient information for someone to successfully implement basic SSR with data fetching in Next.js.

#### Context:

```
It seems there was an issue retrieving the specific documentation for implementing server-side rendering (SSR) with data fetching in Next.js. However, I can explain the concept and provide a general guideline based on typical usage.

### Implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in Next.js

1. **Create a Page Component:**
   Create a new page file in the `pages` directory. Let’s say you create `pages/posts.js`.

2. **Use `getServerSideProps`:**
   This is a special function exported from your page component. It runs on the server when you access the page. You'll fetch your data here.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   const Posts = ({ posts }) => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Posts</h1>
         <ul>
           {posts.map(post => (
             <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
           ))}
         </ul>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export async function getServerSideProps() {
     const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')...
```

### 3. Next.js

**Question**: How do I use middleware in Next.js to protect routes?

**Average Score**: 79.50/100

**Step Count**: 4

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 74/100
  - The context gives a clear, mostly correct overview: creating a middleware file, using NextResponse to redirect unauthenticated users, checking a cookie, and scoping with config.matcher. The code sample aligns with common patterns and would generally work. However, it includes a notable inaccuracy about file placement—middleware must live at the project root (or src root), not inside /pages—which could prevent it from running. It also omits some minor details (e.g., NextRequest type, limitations of middleware, nuances of cookie/header handling). Overall it’s useful but slightly misleading on placement.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 85/100
  - The context provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of how to use middleware in Next.js to protect routes. It covers the essential steps including: creating a middleware file, importing necessary functions, defining middleware logic with authentication checks, and applying middleware to specific routes using the matcher config. The code examples are clear and demonstrate practical implementation. The context directly addresses the question with actionable information. The score is not higher (not 95-100) because: 1) It acknowledges that official documentation wasn't retrieved, suggesting this is general knowledge rather than authoritative source material, 2) It lacks some advanced details like error handling, different authentication strategies, or TypeScript-specific implementations, and 3) It could benefit from mentioning edge runtime considerations or performance implications. However, for a general explanation of route protection with middleware, this context provides strong foundational knowledge that would effectively help someone implement this feature.

#### Context:

```
It looks like there was an issue retrieving the Next.js middleware documentation. However, I can provide an overview of how to use middleware in Next.js to protect routes based on general knowledge.

### Using Middleware in Next.js to Protect Routes

1. **Create a Middleware File**: In your Next.js project, create a file named `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts` in the root of your project or in a specific folder (like `/pages`).

2. **Import the Next Middleware Functionality**: Use the `NextResponse` object to manage responses in your middleware.

   ```javascript
   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
   ```

3. **Define Your Middleware**: You need to export a function that will intercept requests. You can check for authentication or other conditions here.

   ```javascript
   export function middleware(req) {
       // Check for a specific cookie or header
       const token = req.cookies.get('token');

       if (!token) {
           // Redirect to a login page if the token ...
```
