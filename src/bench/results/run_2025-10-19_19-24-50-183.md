### 1. Next.js

**Question**: How do I create a dynamic route in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 83.50/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 72/100
  - The context covers the core concept well: using bracket notation ([slug]) to define dynamic routes, accessing params via useRouter, linking to dynamic routes with Link, and an API dynamic route example. However, it mixes App Router and Pages Router concepts: it places the page in pages/blog/[slug].js but suggests generateStaticParams, which applies to the App Router (app/ directory). In the Pages Router, you would use getStaticPaths (and optionally getStaticProps) for pre-rendering. This mismatch could confuse readers. Despite that, the main steps to create a dynamic route are correctly conveyed.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides excellent, comprehensive information for answering the question about creating dynamic routes in Next.js. It covers all essential aspects: 1) Creating dynamic pages with bracket notation, 2) Accessing dynamic parameters using useRouter, 3) Pre-rendering with generateStaticParams, 4) API routes with dynamic parameters, and 5) Navigation using Link components. The context includes clear code examples for each concept, follows a logical structure, and even provides a summary. The only minor limitation is that it mixes App Router and Pages Router syntax (generateStaticParams is App Router while the examples use Pages Router patterns), which could cause slight confusion, but overall the information is accurate and highly relevant to the question.

#### Context:

```
To create a dynamic route in Next.js, you can follow these basic steps:

### 1. Create a Dynamic Page
You can create a dynamic page by naming the file or folder with brackets (`[]`). For example, to create a dynamic blog post page, create a file in the `pages` directory like this:

```
pages/blog/[slug].js
```

Inside the file, you can use the `useRouter` hook from `next/router` to access the dynamic segment:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter();
  
  return <p>Post: {router.query.slug}</p>;
}
```

### 2. Generate Static Params (Optional)
If you want to pre-render pages at build time, use `generateStaticParams` function. This way, the pages are optimized for performance:

```javascript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then(res => res.json());

  return posts.map(post => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
```

### 2. Next.js

**Question**: How do I implement server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 95.50/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 93/100
  - The context directly answers the question with a clear step-by-step guide, code example using getServerSideProps, and practical notes on performance and caching. It’s highly actionable for the Pages Router. The only notable gap is that it doesn’t cover the App Router (Next.js 13+) approach to SSR with Server Components and fetch caching options, so it’s slightly incomplete for newer setups.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 98/100
  - The context provides an exceptionally comprehensive answer to the question about implementing server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js. It includes: (1) A clear step-by-step implementation guide, (2) Complete, working code example with proper syntax, (3) Detailed explanation of how getServerSideProps works, (4) Important performance considerations and caching optimization techniques, (5) Link to official documentation for further reading. The context covers all essential aspects from basic implementation to advanced optimization. The only minor limitation is that it focuses on the Pages Router approach (getServerSideProps) rather than also covering the newer App Router approach with server components, but for the specific question asked, this is the standard and most commonly used method. The content is accurate, well-structured, and actionable.

#### Context:

```
To implement server-side rendering (SSR) with data fetching in Next.js, you can use the `getServerSideProps` function. This allows you to fetch data from an external API on every request and pass that data as props to your page component. Here is a step-by-step guide along with an example:

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create Your Page Component**:
   Define a component that will display the fetched data. 

2. **Define `getServerSideProps`**:
   Create an async function named `getServerSideProps` that fetches the required data and returns it as props.

3. **Export the Component and the Data Fetching Function**:
   Ensure you export both the component and the `getServerSideProps` function.

### Example Code

Here’s an example of how to implement SSR with data fetching in a Next.js page:

```javascript
// pages/example.js

export default function ExamplePage({ data }) {
  // Render the fetched data
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data from Server</h1>
      {data.map(item => (
  ...
```

### 3. Next.js

**Question**: How do I use middleware in Next.js to protect routes?

**Average Score**: 95.00/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 95/100
  - The context directly answers how to use Next.js middleware to protect routes with clear steps, a practical code example, and configuration via matcher. It explains preserving the original path for post-login redirects and mentions advanced matching and handling. It also links to official docs. Minor omissions include common auth checks via cookies/headers examples, middleware limitations (Edge runtime constraints), and notes on integrating with solutions like NextAuth, but overall it is highly sufficient and actionable.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides excellent coverage for answering the question about using middleware in Next.js to protect routes. It includes: (1) A clear overview explaining what middleware does, (2) Step-by-step implementation instructions with code examples, (3) Configuration details using the matcher pattern, (4) Explanation of key concepts like authentication checks and redirects, (5) Additional features and best practices, and (6) References to official documentation. The code examples are practical and directly relevant to route protection. The only minor limitation is that the authentication function (isAuthValid) is abstract, but this is appropriate for a general explanation. Overall, this context would enable someone to successfully implement middleware-based route protection in Next.js.

#### Context:

```
To protect routes in Next.js using middleware, you can follow these steps:

### Overview of Using Middleware
Middleware in Next.js allows you to intercept requests before they reach your application. This makes it ideal for implementing logic such as authentication checks and redirects.

### Basic Implementation

1. **Create a `middleware.js` File**: Within your Next.js application, create a file named `middleware.js` or `middleware.ts` (for TypeScript).

2. **Write the Middleware Function**: Inside this file, define the middleware function. You can use `NextResponse` to handle redirects based on your authentication logic.

   Here’s a basic example to redirect unauthenticated users to a login page:

   ```javascript
   import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
   import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'
   import { isAuthValid } from './lib/auth' // Assume this checks authentication

   export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
     // Check if the user is authenticate...
```
