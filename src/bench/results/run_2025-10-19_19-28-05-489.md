## Detailed Results

### 1. Next.js

**Question**: How do I create a dynamic route in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 89.50/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 84/100
  - The context clearly explains the core mechanism for creating dynamic routes in Next.js (using square-bracket filenames) and shows how to read params via useRouter, plus includes a relevant example for dynamic API routes. It also addresses pre-rendering, which is useful. However, it mixes Pages Router patterns (pages/ with useRouter and API routes) with an App Router concept (generateStaticParams) without clarifying directory structure differences (pages/ vs app/). The generateStaticParams example has minor inaccuracies for the App Router (e.g., file placement and unnecessary await on params). Despite these issues, the content is largely correct and useful for answering the question.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides comprehensive and highly relevant information for answering the question about creating dynamic routes in Next.js. It covers multiple aspects including: (1) file naming conventions with square brackets, (2) accessing dynamic parameters using useRouter, (3) dynamic API routes, (4) pre-rendering with generateStaticParams, and (5) practical code examples for each concept. The information is well-organized with clear steps and working code samples. The only minor limitation is that it mixes patterns from different Next.js versions (Pages Router and App Router) without clearly distinguishing between them, which could potentially cause slight confusion. However, the core concepts and implementation details are accurate and sufficient to fully answer the question.

#### Context:

````
To create a dynamic route in Next.js, you will follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Dynamic Page

You create a dynamic route by naming your file or folder with square brackets. For example, if you want to create a dynamic route for blog posts, you would create a file like this:

- **File:** `pages/blog/[slug].js`

### 2. Access the Dynamic Route Parameter

Inside your dynamic page, you can use the `useRouter` hook to access the dynamic parameter (e.g., `slug`). Here’s an example:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function PostPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return <p>Post: {slug}</p>;
}
````

### 3. Example of Dynamic API Route

You can also create dynamic API routes using a similar approach. For example, you can create an API route like:

- **File:** `pages/api/user/[id].ts`

Here’s how you can handle it:

```typescript
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default function h...
```

### 2. Next.js

**Question**: How do I implement server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 84.00/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 73/100
  - The context is highly relevant and largely correct for implementing SSR with data fetching in Next.js using getServerSideProps. It explains the lifecycle, provides a clear example, and notes important behaviors (runs on every request, disables static generation, caching considerations). However, there is a significant bug in the cache-control example where the variable name 'res' is reused for the fetch response, shadowing the response object from the function parameters. Additionally, the documentation link appears to point to the App Router path rather than the Pages Router section where getServerSideProps is documented. It also omits the App Router SSR patterns (e.g., server components with fetch), which may be relevant for newer Next.js versions. These issues reduce the score despite the otherwise solid guidance.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides excellent, comprehensive information for implementing server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js. It includes: (1) clear explanation of the getServerSideProps function, (2) complete working code example, (3) step-by-step breakdown of the implementation, (4) important notes about behavior and limitations, (5) advanced example with cache-control headers, and (6) reference to official documentation. The only minor limitation is a small typo in the cache-control example where 'res' is reused as a variable name, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall quality. The context directly and thoroughly answers the question with practical, actionable information.

#### Context:

````
To implement **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** with data fetching in **Next.js**, you use the `getServerSideProps` function. This function is meant to fetch data on each request to ensure the page is pre-rendered with dynamic content. Here's how you can do it:

### Example Code for SSR

```jsx
// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`);
  const data = await res.json();

  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render data here */}
      {JSON.stringify(data)}
    </div>
  );
}
````

### Breakdown

1. **Fetch Data**: Inside `getServerSideProps`, you can use the native `fetch` API to retrieve data from external sources.
2. **Return Props**: The function returns an object with a `props` key, which will pass the fetched data to your page component.
3. **Dynamic Content**: The ...

### 3. Next.js

**Question**: How do I use middleware in Next.js to protect routes?

**Average Score**: 94.50/100

**Step Count**: 3

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 94/100
  - The context directly answers how to protect routes in Next.js using middleware with a clear TypeScript example, explanation of auth checks, redirection, and the matcher configuration. It’s practically ready to copy-paste and customize. Minor omissions include noting where to place middleware.ts (project root or src), edge runtime limitations of middleware, version nuances (Next 12+), and finer details like robust cookie/token validation and adding API routes to matcher if needed. Still, it’s highly relevant and actionable for the question.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides an excellent, comprehensive answer to the question about using middleware in Next.js to protect routes. It includes: (1) A complete, working TypeScript code example showing how to create middleware for route protection, (2) Clear explanation of authentication checking logic, (3) Implementation of redirect logic for unauthenticated users, (4) Proper configuration using the matcher pattern, (5) Detailed step-by-step explanation of each component, and (6) Helpful notes about customization and broader middleware capabilities. The only minor improvement could be mentioning the specific Next.js version or showing alternative authentication methods, but the provided information is highly practical and directly answers the question with production-ready code.

#### Context:

```

To implement middleware in Next.js for route protection, you can create a middleware function that checks for authentication before allowing access to certain routes. Here’s a typical example using TypeScript:

### Example Middleware for Route Protection

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'

// Function to check if the user is authenticated
function isAuthValid(request: NextRequest) {
  // Add your authentication logic here (e.g., checking a cookie or token)
  return !!request.cookies.get('authToken'); // Replace with your actual check
}

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Define paths that require authentication
  const protectedPaths = ['/dashboard', '/profile'];

  // Check if the request path matches any protected paths
  if (protectedPaths.some(path => request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith(path))) {
    // Validate the auth
    if (!isAuthValid(request)) {
      // Redirect to login if not authe...
```
