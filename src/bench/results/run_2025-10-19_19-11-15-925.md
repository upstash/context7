## Detailed Results

### 1. Next.js

**Question**: How do I create a dynamic route in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 95.00/100

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 95/100
  - The context is highly relevant and practical for creating dynamic routes in Next.js. It covers the Pages Router pattern with [slug].js, accessing params via useRouter, and SSG via getStaticPaths/getStaticProps. It also mentions App Router build-time generation with generateStaticParams. Minor gaps: it doesn’t show the App Router file/folder structure (e.g., app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx), how to access params in App Router (params prop or useParams from next/navigation), or advanced patterns like catch-all/optional catch-all routes. Still, it’s more than sufficient to answer the question effectively.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides excellent coverage for answering the question about creating dynamic routes in Next.js. It includes: (1) Clear step-by-step instructions for creating dynamic route files using bracket notation [slug].js, (2) Code examples showing how to access dynamic parameters using useRouter, (3) Comprehensive explanation of static generation using getStaticPaths and getStaticProps with working code samples, (4) Modern App Router approach with generateStaticParams, and (5) A reference to official documentation. The content is well-structured, includes multiple approaches (Pages Router and App Router), and provides complete, functional code examples. The only minor limitation is it doesn't cover catch-all routes or optional catch-all routes, which are also part of dynamic routing in Next.js, hence not a perfect 100.

#### Context:

```
To create a dynamic route in **Next.js**, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Dynamic Route File
You need to create a file that has a dynamic segment in its name. For example, if you want to create a blog page that varies based on the blog post's slug, you would create a folder structure like this:

```
pages/
  blog/
    [slug].js
```

### 2. Accessing Dynamic Parameters
Inside your `[slug].js` file, you can access the dynamic slug using the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. Here’s a simple example:

```jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function BlogPost() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { slug } = router.query

  return <p>Post: {slug}</p>
}
```

### 3. Static Generation with `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`
If you're using static generation, you need to define the dynamic routes beforehand. You can achieve this with `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`. Here’s how it looks:

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = aw...
```

### 2. Next.js

**Question**: How do I implement server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js?

**Average Score**: 95.00/100

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 95/100
  - The context directly addresses SSR with data fetching in Next.js using getServerSideProps, provides a clear code example, explains how it runs per-request, and shows how to set cache headers. It also covers the App Router case with dynamic fetching via fetch('...', { cache: 'no-store' }). While it doesn’t mention other App Router options like revalidate: 0 or dynamic = 'force-dynamic', the provided information is sufficient and practical for implementing SSR in both Pages and App directories.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides excellent coverage for answering the question about implementing server-side rendering with data fetching in Next.js. It includes: (1) A clear explanation of the getServerSideProps function for SSR, (2) A complete working code example showing both the page component and data fetching function, (3) Step-by-step explanation of how the implementation works, (4) Additional advanced topics like cache control headers, (5) Coverage of the newer App Directory approach for Next.js 13+, and (6) Reference to official documentation. The only minor limitation is that it could have mentioned error handling or loading states, but overall this is comprehensive and directly addresses the question with practical, actionable information.

#### Context:

```
To implement server-side rendering (SSR) with data fetching in Next.js, you can use the `getServerSideProps` function. This function allows you to fetch data from an external API on every request and pass that data to your page component as props.

### Example Implementation

Here’s a basic example:

```jsx
export default function Page({ data }) {
  // Render the fetched data
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render data here */}
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// This function runs on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from an external API
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { props: { data } };
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Page Component**: The main page component receives `data` as a prop and renders it.

2. **getServerSideProps Function**: 
   - This function is executed on the server for every inc...

### 3. Next.js

**Question**: How do I use middleware in Next.js to protect routes?

**Average Score**: 94.50/100

#### Jury Scores:

- **gpt-5**: 94/100
  - The context directly answers how to use Next.js middleware to protect routes with clear, correct code examples. It shows creating a middleware function, performing an auth check, redirecting unauthenticated users, and scoping the middleware via the matcher—exactly what the question asks. It also includes a summary and a link to official docs. Minor omissions include not explicitly stating the middleware file location (middleware.ts at the project root) and not covering a few edge considerations (e.g., cookie/session handling specifics, excluding additional routes), but these do not detract much from its usefulness.

- **claude-sonnet-4-5**: 95/100
  - The context provides an excellent and comprehensive answer to the question. It includes: (1) A clear step-by-step guide on implementing middleware for route protection, (2) Complete, working TypeScript code examples showing the middleware function, (3) Explanation of the matcher configuration to specify which routes to protect, (4) Guidance on implementing authentication logic, (5) A full working example combining all components, (6) A helpful summary of the key steps, and (7) A reference link to official documentation. The only minor limitation is that the 'isAuthValid' function is referenced but not fully implemented, though this is appropriately noted as needing custom authentication logic. The context directly and thoroughly addresses how to use middleware in Next.js to protect routes.

#### Context:

```
To protect routes in Next.js using middleware, you can implement an authentication check that redirects unauthenticated users to a login page. Here’s a step-by-step example including the necessary code:

### Step 1: Create Middleware

You need to create a middleware function that checks if a user is authenticated and redirect if not.

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import { isAuthValid } from './lib/auth'; // Replace with your authentication logic

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Check if the user is authenticated
  if (!isAuthValid(request)) {
    // If not, redirect them to the login page
    request.nextUrl.searchParams.set('from', request.nextUrl.pathname); // Preserve the original path
    request.nextUrl.pathname = '/login'; // Redirect to login page
    return NextResponse.redirect(request.nextUrl);
  }
  
  // Proceed to the requested page
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```
