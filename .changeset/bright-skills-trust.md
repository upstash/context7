Skill search & generate command improvements:

- Add "Installs" and "Trust(0-10)" columns to skill search results with aligned column headers
- Auto-login via OAuth when the generate command requires authentication instead of showing an error
- Reorder question options so the recommended choice always appears first with a "✓ Recommended" badge
- Add "View skill" action that opens generated content in the user's default editor (`$EDITOR`)
- Revamp generate wizard copy: do/don't examples for skill descriptions, rename "libraries" to "sources", and clarify follow-up question and generation spinner text
