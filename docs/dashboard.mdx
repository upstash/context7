title: Dashboard
---

Your central hub for managing documentation access, team collaboration, and usage monitoring.

Access your dashboard at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard)

## Quick Actions

- Copy your API key or regenerate it from **Overview → API Connection**
- Monitor rate limits and token usage in **Overview → Usage Statistics**
- Control access to libraries and repositories in **Libraries**
- Invite teammates and manage roles in **Members**
- Upgrade your plan or manage billing directly from the Dashboard sidebar

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard has three main tabs for managing different aspects of your project.

### Overview Tab

Your project's command center.

**Usage Statistics**:
View your last 30 days of activity:
- **Search requests**: How many library searches you've performed
- **Query/fetch requests**: Documentation retrieval count
- **Query tokens**: Total tokens returned in responses
- **Parsing tokens**: Tokens used when adding/refreshing libraries

**API Connection**:
- Copy your API key (starts with `ctx7sk`)
- View rate limits for your current plan
- See example configurations for MCP and REST API

**Project Settings**:
- Rename your project
- Delete team projects (if no private repos exist)
- View project metadata

### Libraries Tab

Control which libraries your project can access.

**Public Library Access**:

Choose your access level:
- **All Libraries** (default): Access all public documentation
- **Select Libraries**: Whitelist specific libraries only
- **Disabled**: Block all public library access

**Token Limits**:
Set maximum tokens per API request (default: 10,000). Lower limits = faster responses and lower costs for large libraries.

**Private Repositories** (Pro/Team only):
- Add private GitHub/GitLab repositories
- View all private repos with access
- Remove private repositories
- See parsing status and token count

### Members Tab

Manage your team and API access (Team projects only).

**Team Members**:
- View all members and their roles
- Invite new members via email
- Update member roles (Owner, Admin, Developer)
- Remove team members
- View pending invitations

**API Keys**:
Each member gets their own API key with 60 req/hour. Regenerate keys for security.

**Billing Estimate**:
View your monthly costs:
- Member seats: $7/month each
- Parse tokens: $15 per 1M tokens

## Personal vs Team Projects

| Feature | Personal Project | Team Project |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Members | You only | Up to 20 |
| Private repos | ❌ | ✅ |
| Billing | Free | Usage-based |
| Can delete | No | Yes* |
| Rate limits | 60 req/hr | 60 req/hr per member |

*Team projects can only be deleted if they have no private repositories.

### Personal Projects

Every user gets one personal project automatically:
- Always free
- Access to all public libraries
- Cannot be deleted
- Single user access
- Perfect for individual development

### Team Projects

Create up to 5 team projects for collaboration:
- Invite team members
- Add private repositories
- Role-based access control
- Usage-based billing
- Shared API access

## Getting Your API Key

1. Go to **Dashboard → Overview**
2. Find the **API Connection** section
3. Click to copy your API key
4. Keep it secure - treat it like a password

### Using Your API Key

**MCP Server**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**REST API**:
```bash
curl "https://context7.com/api/v1/vercel/next.js" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Managing Libraries

### Adding Public Libraries

Public libraries are submitted through the web interface, not the dashboard.

1. Go to [context7.com/add-library](https://context7.com/add-library)
2. Enter repository URL
3. Configure parsing options
4. Submit for processing

See [Library Owners](/library-owners) for detailed configuration.

### Adding Private Repositories

<Note>
Requires Pro or Team plan. See [Plans & Pricing](/plans-pricing).
</Note>

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Libraries → Private Repositories**
2. Click **Add Private Repository**
3. Enter repository URL
4. Provide access token:
   - GitHub: Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
   - GitLab: Personal Access Token with `read_repository` scope
5. Configure folders and exclusions (optional)
6. Submit

**Cost**: $15 per 1M tokens parsed (one-time when adding, incremental when refreshing).

### Refreshing Libraries

Update library documentation:

1. Visit [context7.com/refresh-library](https://context7.com/refresh-library)
2. Enter library ID (e.g., `/vercel/next.js`)
3. Submit

Private repos: You only pay for new/changed content.

## Team Collaboration

### Creating a Team Project

1. Click **Create Team Project** in the dashboard
2. Enter project name
3. You're automatically set as Owner

### Inviting Team Members

1. Go to **Dashboard → Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter email address
4. Select role:
   - **Owner**: Full control, billing access, cannot be removed
   - **Admin**: Manage members, libraries, and settings
   - **Developer**: API access and documentation viewing only
5. Send invitation

Members receive an email invite to join.

### Managing Roles

Change member roles from the Members tab. Only Owners can modify other Owners.

### Removing Members

1. Go to **Dashboard → Members**
2. Click remove icon next to member
3. Confirm removal

Their API key is immediately revoked.

## Usage Monitoring

### Understanding Metrics

**Search Requests**:
Times you searched for libraries via API (`/v1/search` endpoint).

**Query/Fetch Requests**:
Times you retrieved documentation (`/v1/{owner}/{repo}` endpoint).

**Query Tokens**:
Total tokens returned in API responses. Doesn't affect billing directly.

**Parsing Tokens**:
Tokens processed when adding or refreshing private repositories. **This is what you're billed for** on Pro plans.

### Cost Calculation

**Free Plan**: $0 (always)

**Pro Plan**:
- Base: $7/month per team member
- Plus: $15 per 1M parsing tokens (private repos only)

**Example**:
- 3 team members = $21/month
- Added 750K token private repo = $11.25 one-time
- Refreshed with 50K new content = $0.75
- Monthly total = $21 + usage

See [Plans & Pricing](/plans-pricing) for detailed pricing.

### Viewing Logs

Check parsing status and errors:

1. Visit any library page (e.g., `context7.com/upstash/docs`)
2. Click **View Logs**
3. See real-time parsing progress and any errors

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

- ❌ Never commit to version control
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Revoke compromised keys immediately
- ✅ Use separate keys for different environments

### Access Management

- Give team members minimum required role
- Review team members regularly
- Remove members who no longer need access
- Monitor usage for unusual patterns

### Private Repository Security

- Use tokens with minimum required scopes
- Rotate repository tokens periodically
- Remove unused private repositories
- Audit access regularly

See [Security](/security) for comprehensive guidelines.

## Billing and Payments

### Adding Payment Method

1. Click **Add Payment Method** in Dashboard
2. Enter card details via Stripe
3. Submit securely

Your card is charged monthly for team seats and parsing usage.

### Viewing Invoices

Invoices are emailed monthly and include:
- Member seat charges
- Parse token usage
- Total amount

Download from your email or request from support.

### Downgrading

To downgrade from Pro to Free:

1. Remove all team members except yourself
2. Delete all private repositories
3. Visit [Plans & Pricing](https://context7.com/plans)
4. Click **Choose Free Plan**

<Warning>
Downgrading removes team collaboration and private repository access.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not authorized to access this project"**
- Verify you're logged in with the correct account
- Check you're a member of the project
- Ask the project owner to invite you

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait for your hourly limit to reset (60 req/hr)
- Pro plan: Each team member gets their own 60 req/hr
- Enterprise: Contact us for custom limits

**"Private repository access denied"**
- Verify your access token is valid and not expired
- Check token has required scopes (`repo` for GitHub)
- Ensure you're on a Pro or Team plan

**"Library not found"**
- Verify the library ID format (`/owner/repo`)
- Check the library exists at [context7.com](https://context7.com)
- Try searching for it first

See [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) for more solutions.
