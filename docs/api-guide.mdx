---

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY
```

Get your API key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard). Learn more about [creating and managing API keys](/dashboard/api-keys).

<Warning>
  Store your API key in an environment variable or secret manager. Rotate it if compromised.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

- **Without API key**: Low rate limits and no custom configuration
- **With API key**: Higher limits based on your plan
- View current usage and reset windows in the [dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).

When you exceed rate limits, the API returns a `429` status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Too many requests",
  "status": 429
}
```

## Best Practices

### Be Specific with Queries

Use detailed, natural language queries for better results:

```bash
# Good - specific question
curl "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js&query=How%20to%20implement%20authentication%20with%20middleware" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY"

# Less optimal - vague query
curl "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js&query=auth" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY"
```

### Cache Responses

Store documentation locally to reduce API calls and improve performance. Documentation updates are relatively infrequent, so caching for several hours or days is usually appropriate.

### Handle Rate Limits

Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors:

```python
import time
import requests

def fetch_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 429:
            # Wait before retrying with exponential backoff
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            continue

        return response

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### Use Specific Versions

Specify exact versions for consistent results across deployments:

```bash
# Pin to a specific version
curl "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js/v15.1.8&query=app%20router" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY"
```

## Error Handling

The Context7 API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description                               | Action                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | Success                                   | Process the response normally                |
| 202  | Accepted - Library not finalized          | Wait and retry later                         |
| 301  | Moved - Library redirected                | Use the new library ID from `redirectUrl`    |
| 400  | Bad Request - Invalid parameters          | Check query parameters                       |
| 401  | Unauthorized - Invalid API key            | Check your API key format (starts with `ctx7sk`) |
| 403  | Forbidden - Access denied                 | Check library access permissions             |
| 404  | Not Found - Library doesn't exist         | Verify the library ID                        |
| 422  | Unprocessable - Library too large/no code | Try a different library                      |
| 429  | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded   | Wait for `Retry-After` header, then retry    |
| 500  | Internal Server Error                     | Retry with backoff                           |
| 503  | Service Unavailable - Search failed       | Retry later                                  |

### Error Response Format

All errors return a JSON object with these fields:

```json
{
  "error": "library_not_found",
  "message": "Library \"/owner/repo\" not found."
}
```

## SDK and Libraries

### MCP Server (Recommended)

The Context7 Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides seamless integration with Claude and other AI tools:

```bash
npm install @upstash/context7-mcp
```

**Tools provided:**
- `resolve-library-id`: Search for libraries and get their Context7 IDs
- `query-docs`: Get documentation context for your questions

See the [Installation guide](https://github.com/upstash/context7#installation) for setup instructions.

### Direct API Integration

For custom integrations or non-MCP use cases, use the REST endpoints directly. The API is language-agnostic and works with any HTTP client.

**Example (cURL):**

```bash
curl "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js&query=routing" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY"
```

**Example (Python):**

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY"
}

# Search for a library
search = requests.get(
    "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search",
    headers=headers,
    params={"libraryName": "nextjs", "query": "routing"}
)
library_id = search.json()["results"][0]["id"]

# Get documentation context
response = requests.get(
    "https://context7.com/api/v2/context",
    headers=headers,
    params={"libraryId": library_id, "query": "How to setup dynamic routes"}
)
print(response.text)
```

**Example (JavaScript/Node.js):**

```javascript
const headers = { Authorization: "Bearer CONTEXT7_API_KEY" };

// Search for a library
const search = await fetch(
  "https://context7.com/api/v2/libs/search?libraryName=react&query=state",
  { headers }
);
const { results } = await search.json();

// Get documentation context
const docs = await fetch(
  `https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=${results[0].id}&query=useState hook`,
  { headers }
);
const context = await docs.text();
```
