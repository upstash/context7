Context7 brings up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly into your AI coding assistant. No more outdated examples or hallucinated APIs.

## Why Context7?

**The Problem:**
- LLMs use outdated training data from months or years ago
- Hallucinated APIs that don't actually exist
- Generic answers that don't match your library version

**The Solution:**
Context7 fetches current documentation in real-time, so your AI assistant always has the latest information.

## Quick Example

Instead of hoping your AI knows the latest API:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies. use context7
```

Context7 automatically pulls the current Next.js documentation into the AI's context.

## Three Steps to Get Started

### Before You Begin

- Sign up or log in at [context7.com](https://context7.com) to access the dashboard
- (Optional) Generate an API key for higher rate limits
- Confirm your MCP client (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) is on the latest version
- Ensure Node.js v18+ is installed if you plan to run the local MCP server

### 1. Install Context7 MCP

Choose your preferred client below for installation instructions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cursor" icon="cursor">
    **One-Click Install** (Cursor 1.0+):

    Click → `Settings` → `Cursor Settings` → `MCP` → `Add new global MCP server`

    **Remote Server (Recommended)**:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "context7": {
          "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Or add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` manually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude Code" icon="code">
    **Remote Server**:
    ```bash
    claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp \
      --header "CONTEXT7_API_KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    **Local Server**:
    ```bash
    claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="VS Code" icon="code">
    Add to your VS Code MCP config:

    ```json
    "mcp": {
      "servers": {
        "context7": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windsurf" icon="wind">
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "context7": {
          "serverUrl": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Other Clients" icon="ellipsis">
    Context7 supports 25+ MCP clients including:
    - Zed, Cline, Amp
    - JetBrains AI Assistant
    - OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI
    - LM Studio, Perplexity
    - And many more...

    See the [README](https://github.com/upstash/context7) for detailed instructions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
**API Key**: Get yours at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits. Works without a key for basic usage.
</Note>

### 2. Try It Out

Add `use context7` to any coding prompt:

```txt
Build a Redis rate limiter with sliding window. use context7
```

```txt
Set up Supabase auth with Next.js middleware. use context7
```

Context7 automatically finds and retrieves the relevant documentation.

### 3. Optimize Your Workflow

**Auto-invoke Context7** by adding a rule to your AI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    Go to `Cursor Settings` → `Rules` and add:
    ```txt
    Always use context7 for code generation and library documentation.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windsurf">
    Add to `.windsurfrules` in your project:
    ```txt
    Use context7 for all code and API questions.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    Add to `CLAUDE.md` in your project:
    ```txt
    Use context7 when generating code or explaining APIs.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now you don't need to type "use context7" every time!

## How It Works

1. **You prompt your AI** with a coding question
2. **Context7 MCP intercepts** library names from your prompt
3. **Documentation is fetched** in real-time from Context7's database
4. **AI responds** with current, accurate information

All happening seamlessly in the background.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **MCP Client**: Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, or another MCP-supported IDE
- **API Key**: Optional, but recommended for higher rate limits

<Tip>
Not sure everything is wired up? Run `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @upstash/context7-mcp` to validate the connection before you jump back into coding.
