Context7 Enterprise converts your internal documentation into structured, high-quality context optimized for LLMs — enabling human developers, coding agents, and engineering leaders to build faster and operate with clarity.

## Core Use Cases

### Assist Human Developers

Cut onboarding time and reduce internal support load.

- Faster onboarding and fewer interruptions
- Immediate API/service reference inside IDEs
- Always-up-to-date documentation context
- Reduced Slack/Teams dependency

### Power Coding Agents With Correct Documentation

Let your agents write correct code on the first try.

- Supply agents with accurate repo + docs context
- Reduce hallucinations and incorrect API calls
- Enable autonomous generation, refactoring, and analysis
- Feed structured context into LangGraph/agent frameworks

### Engineering Management & Knowledge Governance

One source of truth. Zero stale docs.

- Enforce documentation and context rules across projects
- Automatically parse APIs, RST/Sphinx, MDX, OpenAPI
- Detect outdated or inconsistent sections
- Maintain a single source of truth across engineering

## Enterprise Features

- **SOC 2 certified** cloud infrastructure
- **SSO** (SAML / OIDC)
- Unlimited seats and teamspaces
- Custom volume expansions and high-usage plans
- Private GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket repository ingestion
- Professional support with response time SLA
- Self-hosted deployment options available

## Security & Compliance

Context7 runs on **SOC 2 Type II** compliant infrastructure provided by [Upstash](https://upstash.com). Key security highlights include:

- **Privacy-first architecture** — your original prompts and code never leave your AI assistant. Only MCP-formulated search queries reach the Context7 API, and sensitive data is stripped before transmission.
- **Encryption** at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- **VPC isolation**, RBAC, DDoS protection, and 24/7 monitoring
- **API key security** — cryptographically generated, hashed, encrypted, and rate-limited
- **Enterprise SSO** — supports SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- **GDPR compliant** with data access, deletion, and portability rights
- Data stored in the US and EU with cross-border transfers following GDPR and EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
- **ISO 27001** certification in progress
- Open-source MCP server — publicly auditable at [github.com/upstash/context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)

Enterprise customers can also disable query storage, use their own LLM provider for code extraction and private library ranking, and limit context retrieval to privately indexed documentation only.

## Quality & Safety

Context7 is built with retrieval quality and trust at its core:

- **Benchmark-driven retrieval** — a library benchmark system generates developer-style questions and measures how effectively each library answers them. Scores are publicly visible and help prioritize better-performing libraries during retrieval.
- **Trust scores** — every library receives a trust score based on repository signals (stars, activity, account age) and website signals (TLS, domain authority, backlinks). This ensures reliable, well-established libraries are surfaced first.
- **Deduplication** — exact match checking and cosine similarity filtering remove redundant code snippets and overlapping documentation content.
- **Version-aware parsing** — a version analyzer detects multi-version documentation structures, ensuring only current docs are stored by default while older versions remain accessible.
- **Prompt injection protection** — a two-pass detection pipeline combining complementary stages blocks malicious documentation content while minimizing false positives. Pipelines are regularly updated to address evolving attack methods.
- **Minimal data ingestion** — Context7 does not ingest user code, conversation history, or other sensitive data.
