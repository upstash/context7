<ParamField path="query" type="str" required>
  The user's question or task (used for relevance ranking)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="library_name" type="str" required>
  The library name to search for
</ParamField>

## Response

Returns `list[Library]` - a list of library objects.

<ResponseField name="Library" type="object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="id" type="str" required>
      Unique identifier for the library (e.g., `/facebook/react`)
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="name" type="str" required>
      Display name of the library
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="description" type="str" required>
      Brief description of the library
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="total_snippets" type="int" required>
      Total number of documentation snippets available
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="trust_score" type="float" required>
      Trust score of the library
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="benchmark_score" type="float" required>
      Benchmark score indicating documentation quality
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="versions" type="list[str] | None">
      Available versions
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>

## Examples

<RequestExample>
```python Basic Search
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    libraries = client.search_library(
        "I need to build a UI",
        "react"
    )

    print(f"Found {len(libraries)} libraries")
    for library in libraries:
        print(f"{library.name}: {library.description}")
```

```python Async Usage
import asyncio
from context7 import Context7

async def main():
    async with Context7() as client:
        libraries = await client.search_library_async(
            "I need to build a UI",
            "react"
        )

        print(f"Found {len(libraries)} libraries")
        for library in libraries:
            print(f"{library.name}: {library.description}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

```python Selecting Best Library
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    libraries = client.search_library(
        "I want to build a web app",
        "next"
    )

    sorted_libs = sorted(libraries, key=lambda x: x.benchmark_score, reverse=True)
    best = sorted_libs[0]

    print(f"Best match: {best.name} (score: {best.benchmark_score})")
    print(f"Available snippets: {best.total_snippets}")
```

```python Error Handling
from context7 import Context7, Context7Error

with Context7() as client:
    try:
        libraries = client.search_library("query", "express")

        if not libraries:
            print("No libraries found")
        else:
            print(f"Found {len(libraries)} libraries")
    except Context7Error as e:
        print(f"API Error: {e}")
```

## Use Cases

### Finding Libraries by Score

```python
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    libraries = client.search_library("state management", "redux")

    trusted = sorted(libraries, key=lambda x: x.trust_score, reverse=True)
    print(f"Most trusted: {trusted[0].name}")
```

### Checking Available Versions

```python
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    libraries = client.search_library("I want to use lodash", "lodash")

    library = libraries[0]
    if library.versions:
        print(f"Available versions: {', '.join(library.versions)}")
```

### Full Workflow

```python
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    libraries = client.search_library(
        "I want to build a React app",
        "react"
    )

    library = libraries[0]
    print(f"Using: {library.name} ({library.id})")

    context = client.get_context(
        "How do I create a component?",
        library.id
    )

    print(context)
```
