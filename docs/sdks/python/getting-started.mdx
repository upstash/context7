  **Work in Progress**: This SDK is currently under active development. The API is subject to change and may introduce breaking changes in future releases.
</Warning>

# Getting Started

`context7` is a Python SDK for Context7, enabling easier access to library documentation with full type hints.

Using `context7` you can:

- Search across available libraries
- Get documentation context for any library
- Access library metadata including trust scores and versions

You can find the Github Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/context7/tree/master/packages/python/sdk).

## Install

<CodeGroup>
  ```shell pip
  pip install context7
  ```

```shell uv
uv add context7
```

```shell poetry
poetry add context7
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

### Initializing the Client

To use the Context7 SDK, you need an API key. You can get your API key from the [Context7 Dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).

#### Using environment variables

The SDK automatically reads from environment variables if no API key is provided:

```bash
CONTEXT7_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

When an environment variable is set, you can initialize the client without any parameters:

```python
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    # Use the client
    pass
```

#### Using a configuration parameter

If you prefer to pass the API key in code:

```python
from context7 import Context7

with Context7(api_key="ctx7sk_...") as client:
    # Use the client
    pass
```

<Note>
  The SDK checks for API keys in this order: 1. `api_key` parameter (if provided) 2.
  `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable
</Note>

## Quick Start Example

### Synchronous Usage

```python
from context7 import Context7

with Context7() as client:
    # Search for libraries
    libraries = client.search_library(
        "I need to build a UI with components",
        "react"
    )
    print(f"Found {len(libraries)} libraries")
    print(libraries[0].id)  # "/facebook/react"

    # Get documentation as JSON array (default)
    docs = client.get_context(
        "How do I use hooks?",
        "/facebook/react"
    )
    print(docs[0].title, docs[0].content)

    # Get documentation as plain text
    context = client.get_context(
        "How do I use hooks?",
        "/facebook/react",
        type="txt"
    )
    print(context)
```

### Asynchronous Usage

```python
import asyncio
from context7 import Context7

async def main():
    async with Context7() as client:
        # Search for libraries
        libraries = await client.search_library_async(
            "I need to build a UI with components",
            "react"
        )
        print(f"Found {len(libraries)} libraries")
        print(libraries[0].id)  # "/facebook/react"

        # Get documentation context (JSON array by default)
        docs = await client.get_context_async(
            "How do I use hooks?",
            "/facebook/react"
        )
        print(docs[0].title, docs[0].content)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Error Handling

The SDK raises `Context7Error` for API errors:

```python
from context7 import Context7, Context7Error

with Context7() as client:
    try:
        context = client.get_context("query", "/invalid/library")
    except Context7Error as e:
        print(f"Context7 API Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```
