description: Get the most out of Context7 with these best practices
---

## Add a Rule

To avoid typing `use context7` in every prompt, add a rule to your MCP client to automatically invoke Context7 for code-related questions:

- **Cursor**: `Cursor Settings > Rules`
- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md`
- Or the equivalent in your MCP client

**Example rule:**

```txt
Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.
```

## Use Library ID

If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. That way, Context7 MCP server can skip the library-matching step and directly continue with retrieving docs.

```txt
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
```

The slash syntax tells the MCP tool exactly which library to load docs for.

## Specify a Version

To get documentation for a specific library version, just mention the version in your prompt:

```txt
How do I set up Next.js 14 middleware? use context7
```

Context7 will automatically match the appropriate version.
