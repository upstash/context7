## Metrics Overview

Context7 tracks four key metrics to help you understand your usage patterns:

### Search & Query Requests

The total number of API calls made to Context7:

- **Search Requests**: Library search queries
- **Query Requests**: Documentation retrieval calls

### Query Tokens

The total number of tokens returned in API responses. This reflects how much documentation content you've retrieved.

<Tip>Search requests, Query requests, and Query tokens do not affect cost.</Tip>

### Parsing Tokens

The total tokens processed when parsing private repository documentation (Pro and Enterprise only).

**How it works**:

- Charged when adding a new private repository
- Charged for changed content when refreshing
- No charge for cached content when refreshing

**Cost**: $15 per 1M tokens

### Total Cost

Your monthly cost in USD (Pro and Enterprise only).

**Calculation**:

```
Total Cost = Parsing Cost + Team Cost

Parsing Cost = (Parsing Tokens / 1,000,000) × $15
Team Cost = Number of Members × $7
```

**Example**:

- Team: 4 members
- Parsing: 800K tokens this month
- Cost: (800K / 1M × $15) + (4 × $7) = $12 + $28 = **$40**
