description: Get your library verified to increase visibility and build trust with developers
---

Verified libraries receive a special badge that signals quality and trustworthiness to developers. Verification helps your library rank higher in search results and gives users confidence that your documentation is reliable.

<Note>Only library owners can apply for verification. You must [claim your library](/howto/claiming-libraries) before applying.</Note>

## Why Get Verified?

Verification provides several benefits for your library:

- **Higher search ranking**: Verified libraries are prioritized in search results and recommendations
- **Trust badge**: A verified badge is displayed on your library page, building confidence with users
- **Increased visibility**: Verified libraries appear more prominently across Context7
- **Broader access**: Teams can restrict their library access to "verified only" - without verification, your library won't be accessible to these users

## Verification Badge

Once verified, your library displays a green checkmark badge next to its name:

  <img src="/images/howto/verification/verification-badge.png" alt="Verified badge on library" />
</Frame>

This badge appears on:
- Your library's main page
- Search results
- Library listings and tables
- Skills associated with your library

## How to Get Verified

There are two paths to verification:

### Automatic Verification

Libraries are automatically verified when they meet certain quality thresholds:

- **High trust score**: Libraries with a trust score of 9 or above. Trust score is calculated based on the GitHub organization/user profile, considering factors like total stars, number of repositories, account age, recent activity, followers, and profile completeness.
- **Top 100 libraries**: Most-used libraries by API requests
- **Top 100 skills**: Libraries with the most-installed skills

Automatic verification is checked daily. If your library qualifies, it will be verified automatically without any action required.

### Manual Verification

If your library doesn't qualify for automatic verification, you can apply manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Claim Your Library">
    You must be a verified owner of the library. See [Claim Your Library](/howto/claiming-libraries) for instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to the Admin Page">
    Navigate to your library's admin page at:

    ```
    https://context7.com/{owner}/{repo}/admin
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply for Verification">
    If your library is not yet verified, you'll see a banner at the top of the configuration page with an "Apply for Verification" button. Click it to open the application form.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the Application">
    Fill out the verification application form:

    | Field | Description | Required |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Website/Docs URL** | Link to your library's official website or documentation | Yes |
    | **Library Description** | Brief description of what your library does | Yes |
    | **Developer Value** | How your library helps developers | Yes |

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/howto/verification/apply-modal.png" alt="Verification application modal" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit for Review">
    Click "Submit Application" to send your request to the Context7 team. You'll be redirected to a GitHub issue where you can track the status of your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Review">
    The Context7 team will review your application and respond on the GitHub issue. Review typically takes 1-3 business days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification Requirements

To be approved for manual verification, your library should:

- **Be a legitimate project**: Real libraries with actual users and documentation
- **Have quality documentation**: Well-organized, up-to-date documentation that helps developers
- **Be actively maintained**: Regular updates and responsive to issues
- **Follow best practices**: Clear README, proper licensing, and good code organization

<Note>
  Verification is free and always will be. We verify libraries based on quality, not payment.
</Note>

## Verification Status

You can check your library's verification status on the admin page:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | Green badge displayed, full verification benefits |
| **Not Verified** | No badge, apply to get verified |

## Skills and Verification

Skills inherit the verification status of their parent library. When your library is verified:

- All skills associated with your library display the verified badge
- Skills rank higher in skill search results

## FAQ

### How long does manual verification take?

Most applications are reviewed within 1-3 business days. Complex cases may take longer.

### Can verification be revoked?

Yes, in rare cases. Verification may be revoked if:
- The library becomes abandoned or unmaintained
- Documentation quality significantly degrades
- The library violates Context7's terms of service

### Does verification cost anything?

No. Verification is completely free and based solely on library quality.

### I was automatically verified. Can I lose it?

Automatic verification is recalculated daily. If your library no longer meets the automatic criteria, you'll retain your verification status but may need to apply manually if it's ever revoked.

### My library is popular but not verified. Why?

Automatic verification considers multiple factors including trust score, usage statistics, and skill installs. If you believe your library should be verified, please apply manually.
