title: Claim Your Library
description: Verify ownership and manage your library's configuration via the admin panel
---

As a library owner, you can claim your library on Context7 to unlock advanced configuration options through a web-based admin panel. This gives you full control over how your documentation is parsed and presented to developers.

<Note>Library claiming is currently only available for GitHub repositories.</Note>

## Why Claim Your Library?

Claiming ownership provides several benefits:

- **Web-based configuration**: Edit settings through a user-friendly interface instead of committing changes
- **Team management**: All project members can manage the library configuration
- **Version management**: Add and manage multiple versions of your library documentation
- **Usage analytics**: View metrics on how developers use your library's documentation
- **Higher refresh limits**: Get higher rate limits for refresh operations to better manage your content

## Claiming Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Admin Page">
    You can access the admin page in two ways:

    **From the Dashboard:**
    Find your library in the dashboard and click the "Manage" button to open the admin configuration page.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard/admin/library-manage-button.png" alt="Manage button on library card" />
    </Frame>

    **Via Direct URL:**
    Go directly to your library's admin page at:

    ```
    https://context7.com/{owner}/{repo}/admin
    ```

    For example: `https://context7.com/vercel/next.js/admin`

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Claim Modal">
    If you haven't claimed the library yet, you'll see a "Claim Library" button in the header. Click it to open the claiming modal.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard/admin/claim-library-button.png" alt="Claim Library button" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Your Public Key">
    In the claiming modal, you'll see a generated `context7.json` configuration with your unique public key:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/dashboard/admin/claim-modal.png" alt="Claim library modal" />
    </Frame>

    The modal provides a JSON snippet like this:

    ```json
    {
      "url": "https://context7.com/vercel/next.js",
      "public_key": "pk_abc123xyz..."
    }
    ```

    Click "Copy" to copy the configuration to your clipboard.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add context7.json to Your Repository">
    Create a `context7.json` file in the **root** of your repository with the copied content:

    ```json
    {
      "url": "https://context7.com/vercel/next.js",
      "public_key": "pk_abc123xyz..."
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
      The `url` must exactly match your library's URL on Context7, and the `public_key` must match the key shown in the modal.
    </Warning>

    Commit and push the file to your repository's default branch.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Ownership">
    Return to the claiming modal and click "Claim Library". Context7 will:

    1. Fetch `context7.json` from your repository
    2. Verify the URL matches your library
    3. Verify the public key matches your project

    Once verified, you'll see a success message and gain access to the admin panel.

    <Note>
      For private repositories, ensure you have the Context7 GitHub App installed with access to the repository.
    </Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Admin Panel Overview

After claiming your library, the admin page shows a full configuration editor with three main tabs:

- **Configuration**: Edit all library settings
- **Versions**: Manage previous versions of your library
- **Metrics**: View usage statistics

## Configuration Fields

### Basic Information

| Field             | Description                                                                                               | Limits             |

<Note>
  `excludeFiles` only accepts filenames, not paths. Use `CHANGELOG.md` instead of
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
</Note>

### LLM Configuration

| **Disallow Indexing** | Opt-out from Context7. When enabled, documentation content is removed and the library becomes inaccessible. | Boolean            |

<Warning>
  Enabling "Disallow Indexing" removes all documentation content from Context7. Only metadata and
  settings are preserved.
</Warning>

## Managing Versions

The Versions tab lets you configure previous versions of your library that should be available in Context7.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/dashboard/admin/managing-versions.png" alt="Versions tab" />
</Frame>

You can add versions using either:

- **Git tags**: Reference a specific release tag (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
- **Git branches**: Reference a branch for version-specific documentation (e.g., `release-1.x`)

| Limit            | Value             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Maximum versions | 20                |
| Tag/branch name  | Max 50 characters |

## Library Metrics

The Metrics tab provides insights into how developers are using your library through Context7.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/dashboard/admin/library-metrics.png" alt="Metrics tab" />
</Frame>

### Usage Statistics

At the top of the metrics page, you'll see key usage numbers:

| Metric                 | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Page Views**         | Number of times your library page was viewed on Context7              |
| **API Requests (TXT)** | Documentation requests via the REST API                               |
| **MCP Requests**       | Documentation requests via the MCP server (from AI coding assistants) |

The metrics page also includes a usage chart showing trends over time, topic queries showing what developers ask about, and country distribution of requests.

<Note>All team members can view and edit library settings. See [Team Management](/howto/team) for role details.</Note>

## Removing Ownership

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Admin Page">
    Navigate to your library's admin page at `https://context7.com/admin/{owner}/{repo}`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Ownership Menu">Click the ownership menu in the header area.</Step>
  <Step title="Remove Ownership">Select "Remove Ownership" and confirm the action.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Removing ownership keeps the admin configuration intact. Another user can claim the library and
  inherit the existing settings.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### "context7.json not found"

Ensure the file is:

- Named exactly `context7.json` (lowercase)
- Located in the repository root, not a subdirectory
- Committed and pushed to the default branch

### "URL mismatch"

The `url` field in your `context7.json` must exactly match:

```
https://context7.com/{owner}/{repo}
```

Check for typos, case sensitivity, and trailing slashes.

### "Public key mismatch"

The `public_key` in your file must match the key shown in the claiming modal. Copy the entire key including the `pk_` prefix.

### "Access denied to repository"

For private repositories, install the [Context7 GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/context7) with access to your repository.

### Changes not appearing

After saving configuration changes, you may need to:

- Manually trigger a refresh from the library page
- Clear any cached documentation on your end
