API keys authenticate your requests to Context7's documentation services.

## Managing API Keys

### Creating API Keys

Generate a new API key in four simple steps:

1. **Click "Create API Key"** in the API Keys card
2. **Enter a name** (optional but recommended)
   - Use descriptive names like "Cursor", "Claude", "VS Code", or "Windsurf"
   - This helps you identify keys later
3. **Copy the key immediately**
   - Keys are shown only once for security
   - Format: `ctx7sk-**********************`
4. **Use in your requests or add to your MCP configuration**:

```bash
curl "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=/vercel/next.js&query=routing" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Warning>Store your API key securely. You won't be able to see it again after creation.</Warning>

### Revoking Keys

Remove API keys you no longer need:

1. **Click the delete button** next to the key
2. **Confirm deletion** in the modal
3. **Key deactivates immediately** - all requests using it will fail

<Note>
  Revoking a key is permanent and cannot be undone. Update any applications using the key before
  revoking.
</Note>
