description: Authenticate with Context7 MCP server using OAuth 2.0
---

<Note>
  OAuth is only available for remote HTTP connections. For local MCP connections using stdio
  transport, use [API key authentication](/howto/api-keys) instead.
</Note>

Context7 MCP server supports OAuth 2.0 authentication for MCP clients that implement the [MCP OAuth specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization).

## Why Use OAuth?

| Feature                    | OAuth | API Keys |
| -------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| No manual key management   | ✅    | ❌       |
| Automatic token refresh    | ✅    | ❌       |
| Works with stdio transport | ❌    | ✅       |

## Configuration

To use OAuth, change the endpoint from `/mcp` to `/mcp/oauth` in your client configuration:

```diff
- "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
+ "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/oauth"
```

## How It Works

1. Your MCP client connects to the OAuth endpoint
2. You're redirected to Context7 to sign in
3. After signing in, you're redirected back to your client
4. Your client automatically handles token refresh

<Warning>
**Authentication required after setup.** Most clients won't authenticate automatically. After adding the OAuth endpoint, you'll need to explicitly authenticate through your client's MCP settings. For example, in Claude Code run `/mcp`, select the server, and choose "Authenticate".
</Warning>

## Client Support

OAuth authentication requires your MCP client to support the [MCP OAuth specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization). If your client doesn't support OAuth, use [API key authentication](/howto/api-keys) instead.
