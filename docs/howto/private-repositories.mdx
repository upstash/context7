## Adding Private Repositories

Follow these steps to add a private repository:

1. Go to the [Add Library](https://context7.com/add-library) page
2. **Connect your account**
   - Choose GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
   - Authorize Context7 to access your repositories
3. **Select a repository** from your account
4. **Submit** for parsing

<Note>You must have a Pro or Enterprise plan to add private repositories.</Note>

## Repository Management

### Refreshing Documentation

Keep your private documentation up to date:

1. **Click "Refresh"** next to the repository
2. Context7 re-parses the repository
3. **You're only charged for changed content** - cached pages are free

**When to refresh**:

- After major documentation updates
- After releasing new features
- When you notice outdated information

<Tip>Refresh private repos only after significant documentation changes to minimize costs.</Tip>

### Removing Repositories

To remove a private repository:

1. **Click "Remove"** next to the repository
2. **Confirm deletion** in the modal
3. Repository documentation becomes unavailable immediately

<Warning>
  This action is permanent. The repository will no longer be accessible via the API.
</Warning>

## Permissions

Access to private repository management is restricted by role. Only Owners and Admins can add, refresh, or remove private repositories. Developers can view repository documentation but cannot manage repositories.

See [Team Management](/howto/team#roles) for the complete permissions table.

## Configuration

### Using `context7.json`

Add a `context7.json` file to your repository root for better control over parsing:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://context7.com/schema/context7.json",
  "projectTitle": "Your Project Name",
  "description": "Brief description of your project",
  "folders": ["docs", "guides"],
  "excludeFolders": ["tests", "dist", "node_modules"],
  "excludeFiles": ["CHANGELOG.md"],
  "rules": ["Always validate user input", "Use TypeScript strict mode"]
}
```

See the [Adding Libraries](/adding-libraries) page for complete configuration options.
