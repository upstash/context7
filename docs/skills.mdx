Skills are reusable prompt templates that extend the capabilities of your AI coding assistants. They allow you to share and install common workflows like code reviews, commit message generation, PDF processing, and more across projects and teams.

Context7 maintains a registry of skills at [context7.com/skills](https://context7.com/skills) that can be installed directly into your AI coding assistant with a single command.

## What Are Skills?

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard — a specification that works across multiple AI coding tools. A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that your AI assistant loads when relevant.

**Why use skills?**

- **Standardize workflows**: Ensure consistent code reviews, commit messages, or documentation across your team
- **Share expertise**: Package domain knowledge (e.g., "how we handle authentication") as reusable prompts
- **Save time**: Install pre-built skills instead of repeatedly explaining the same patterns to your AI assistant

**Example use cases:**

- Generate commit messages following your team's conventions
- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Process PDFs and extract structured data
- Scaffold components using your preferred patterns

## The Context7 Skills Registry

The [Context7 Skills Registry](https://context7.com/skills) is a searchable marketplace of skills indexed from GitHub repositories. Each skill is identified by its repository path (e.g., `/anthropics/skills`) and skill name.

When browsing or searching skills, you'll see:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | The skill identifier used for installation |
| **Description** | What the skill does and when to use it |
| **Install Count** | Number of times the skill has been installed |
| **Trust Score** | Quality and safety indicator (0-10) |

## Trust Scores

Every skill in the registry has a **trust score** from 0 to 10 that indicates the reliability and safety of the skill source.

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 7.0 - 10.0 | High | Verified or well-established source |
| 3.0 - 6.9 | Medium | Standard community contribution |
| 0.0 - 2.9 | Low | New or unverified — review before using |

Trust scores help you make informed decisions about which skills to install. Higher scores indicate skills from reputable sources with community validation.

### Security Features

Context7 automatically scans skills for potential security issues:

- **Prompt injection detection**: Skills containing potentially malicious instructions are blocked from installation
- **Blocked skill warnings**: When viewing a repository, you'll see how many skills were blocked due to security concerns
- **Clear error messages**: If you try to install a blocked skill, you'll receive a specific warning explaining why

## Prerequisites

Skills require the Context7 CLI. You need Node.js 18 or later.

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no installation required)
npx ctx7 skills search pdf

# Or install globally for faster access
npm install -g ctx7
```

## CLI Commands

### Install Skills

Install skills from a repository to your AI coding assistant's skills directory.

```bash
# Interactive selection from a repository
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills

# Install a specific skill
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf

# Install multiple skills at once
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf commit

# Install all skills without prompting
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills --all
```

**Target a specific client:**

```bash
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --claude
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --cursor
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --codex
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --opencode
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --amp
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --antigravity
```

**Install globally** (available in all projects):

```bash
ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --global
```

<Note>
When installing to multiple clients, the CLI creates the skill files in your primary client's directory and symlinks them to other clients.
</Note>

### Search Skills

Find skills across all indexed repositories in the registry.

```bash
ctx7 skills search pdf
ctx7 skills search typescript
ctx7 skills search "react testing"
```

Search results display:
- Skill name and repository
- Description
- Install count
- Trust score

You can install directly from search results by selecting a skill interactively.

### List Installed Skills

View skills installed in your project or globally.

```bash
# List all installed skills
ctx7 skills list

# List for a specific client
ctx7 skills list --claude
ctx7 skills list --cursor

# List globally installed skills
ctx7 skills list --global
```

### Show Skill Information

Get details about all available skills in a repository.

```bash
ctx7 skills info /anthropics/skills
```

This displays:
- Available skill names
- Descriptions
- Direct URLs
- Quick install commands

### Remove Skills

Uninstall a skill from your project or global directory.

```bash
# Remove with interactive prompts
ctx7 skills remove pdf

# Remove from a specific client
ctx7 skills remove pdf --claude

# Remove from global directory
ctx7 skills remove pdf --global
```

## Generate Custom Skills

Create custom skills tailored to your specific needs using AI. This feature requires authentication.

### Authentication

```bash
# Log in (opens browser for OAuth)
ctx7 login

# Check your login status
ctx7 whoami

# Log out
ctx7 logout
```

### Generate a Skill

```bash
# Start interactive generation
ctx7 skills generate

# Generate for a specific client
ctx7 skills generate --cursor
ctx7 skills generate --claude

# Generate as a global skill
ctx7 skills generate --global
```

### Generation Workflow

1. **Describe your expertise**: Enter what you want the skill to do (e.g., "OAuth authentication with NextAuth.js best practices")
2. **Select documentation**: Search and choose relevant libraries to inform the skill
3. **Answer questions**: Respond to 3 clarifying questions to focus the skill
4. **Review**: See the generated skill and optionally request changes
5. **Install**: Save the skill to your selected client(s)

<Tip>
Describe best practices and constraints, not step-by-step tutorials. For example, "TypeScript strict mode patterns" is better than "how to write TypeScript."
</Tip>

### Generation Limits

| Plan | Generations per Week |
|------|---------------------|
| Free | 6 |
| Pro | 10 |

Check your remaining quota:

```bash
ctx7 whoami
```

## Supported Clients

The CLI automatically detects installed AI coding assistants and offers to install skills for them.

| Client | Project Directory | Global Directory |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| Amp | `.agents/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/skills/` | `~/.agent/skills/` |

**Project vs Global:**
- **Project skills** (default): Installed in your current project directory, available only in that project
- **Global skills** (`--global`): Installed in your home directory, available across all projects

## Skill File Structure

Each skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` file:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
├── templates/         # Optional templates
├── examples/          # Optional example outputs
└── scripts/           # Optional executable scripts
```

### SKILL.md Format

Skills use YAML frontmatter followed by markdown instructions:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

Instructions for the AI assistant go here.

Use markdown formatting, code examples, and clear steps.
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Identifier for the skill (lowercase, hyphens allowed) |
| `description` | Yes | Explains what the skill does — used for discovery |

The markdown body contains the actual instructions your AI assistant follows when the skill is invoked.

## Command Shortcuts

For faster usage, the CLI provides short aliases:

| Shortcut | Full Command |
|----------|--------------|
| `ctx7 si` | `ctx7 skills install` |
| `ctx7 ss` | `ctx7 skills search` |
| `ctx7 skills i` | `ctx7 skills install` |
| `ctx7 skills s` | `ctx7 skills search` |
| `ctx7 skills ls` | `ctx7 skills list` |
| `ctx7 skills rm` | `ctx7 skills remove` |
| `ctx7 skills gen` | `ctx7 skills generate` |
| `ctx7 skills g` | `ctx7 skills generate` |

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you see permission errors when installing or removing skills:

```bash
# Try with sudo for global installations
sudo ctx7 skills install /anthropics/skills pdf --global
```

Or fix directory permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.claude/skills
```

### Skill Blocked Due to Prompt Injection

If a skill is blocked, it contains content flagged as potentially malicious. This is a security feature — the skill cannot be installed.

```
Error: This skill contains potentially malicious content and cannot be installed.
```

Consider using an alternative skill or contacting the skill author.

### Client Not Detected

If your AI coding assistant isn't detected, ensure its configuration directory exists:

```bash
# For Claude Code
mkdir -p .claude

# For Cursor
mkdir -p .cursor
```

### Authentication Issues

If login fails or tokens expire:

```bash
# Clear stored credentials
ctx7 logout

# Log in again
ctx7 login
```
