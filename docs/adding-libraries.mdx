title: Library Owners

Context7 allows you to add your favorite libraries and frameworks so developers always receive current, trustworthy documentation inside their coding environment.

## Quick Submission

The fastest way to add a library is through our web interface:

**[Submit a Library ->](https://context7.com/add-library?tab=github)**

1. Paste the GitHub repository URL.
2. (Optional) Adjust folders and exclusions.
3. Submit and let Context7 parse and index the documentation.

<Note>
  For private repositories, see the [Private Repositories](/dashboard/private-repositories) guide.
  Requires a Pro or Enterprise plan.
</Note>

## Advanced Configuration with `context7.json`

For more control over how Context7 parses and presents your library, you can add a `context7.json` file to the root of your repository. This file works similarly to `robots.txt` and tells Context7 how to handle your project.

### Configuration Fields

Here's an example `context7.json` file with all available options:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://context7.com/schema/context7.json",
  "projectTitle": "Upstash Ratelimit",
  "description": "Ratelimiting library based on Upstash Redis",
  "folders": [],
  "excludeFolders": ["src"],
  "excludeFiles": [],
  "rules": ["Use Upstash Redis as a database", "Use single region set up"],
  "previousVersions": [
    {
      "tag": "v1.2.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  **Pro Tip**: Including the `$schema` field enables autocomplete, validation, and helpful tooltips
  in modern code editors like VS Code, making it easier to create and maintain your configuration.
</Note>

## Field Descriptions

- **`projectTitle`** (string): Suggested display name for your project in Context7. Only used when the LLM cannot generate a name with high confidence.

- **`description`** (string): Suggested description for your project in Context7. Only used when the LLM cannot generate a description with high confidence.

- **`branch`** (string): The name of the git branch to parse. If not provided, the default branch will be used.

- **`folders`** (array): Specific folder paths to include when parsing. If empty, Context7 scans the entire repository. Root-level markdown files are always included.

- **`excludeFolders`** (array): Patterns to exclude from documentation parsing. Supports simple names, paths, and glob patterns (see Exclusion Patterns below).

- **`excludeFiles`** (array): Specific file names to exclude. Use only the filename, not the full path. Examples: `CHANGELOG.md`, license files, or non-documentation content.

- **`rules`** (array): Best practices or important guidelines that coding agents should follow when using your library. These appear as recommendations in the documentation context provided to coding agents.

- **`previousVersions`** (array): Information about previous versions of your library that should also be available in Context7.
  - **`tag`**: The Git tag or version identifier

- **`branchVersions`** (array): Information about previous versions (branch-based) of your library that should also
  be available in Context7.
  - **`branch`**: The Git branch

### Exclusion Patterns

The `excludeFolders` parameter supports various pattern types for flexible exclusion:

- **Simple folder names**: `"node_modules"` - Excludes any folder named "node_modules" anywhere in the tree
- **Root-specific patterns**: `"./xyz"` - Excludes the folder only at repository root (e.g., excludes `/xyz` but not `/dist/xyz`)
- **Path patterns**: `"app-sdk/v2.3"` - Excludes specific paths and everything under them
- **Glob patterns**: `"*.test"`, `"temp*"` - Excludes folders matching the pattern
- **Globstar patterns**: `"**/dist"`, `"docs/**/internal"` - Advanced path matching
- **Complex patterns**: `"src/**/*.test.js"` - Exclude test files in the src directory

Examples:

- `"node_modules"` - Excludes all node_modules folders anywhere
- `"./build"` - Excludes the build folder only at root (not `src/build`)
- `"app-sdk/v2.3"` - Excludes the app-sdk/v2.3 path and all its contents
- `"*.test"` - Excludes folders ending with .test
- `"docs/**/internal"` - Excludes any "internal" folder under docs
- `"**/temp"` - Excludes any folder named "temp" anywhere

### Default Exclusions

If you don't specify `excludeFiles` or `excludeFolders` in your `context7.json` file, Context7 uses these default patterns:

#### Default Excluded Files

```
CHANGELOG.md, changelog.md, CHANGELOG.mdx, changelog.mdx
LICENSE.md, license.md
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, code_of_conduct.md
```

#### Default Excluded Folders

```
*archive*, *archived*, old, docs/old, *deprecated*, *legacy*
*previous*, *outdated*, *superseded*
i18n/zh*, i18n/es*, i18n/fr*, i18n/de*, i18n/ja*, i18n/ko*
i18n/ru*, i18n/pt*, i18n/it*, i18n/ar*, i18n/hi*, i18n/tr*
i18n/nl*, i18n/pl*, i18n/sv*, i18n/vi*, i18n/th*
zh-cn, zh-tw, zh-hk, zh-mo, zh-sg
```

These defaults help coding agents avoid irrelevant, outdated, and non-technical content.

## Claiming Your Library

If you're the library owner, you can claim your library on Context7 to unlock a web-based admin panel for managing configuration. This allows you to:

- Edit settings through a user interface instead of committing file changes
- Invite team members to collaborate on configuration
- Add and manage multiple versions of your library documentation
- Get higher rate limits for refresh operations

**[Learn more about claiming libraries →](/dashboard/claiming-libraries)**

## Who Can Manage Configuration?

- **Library authors**: Claim ownership via `context7.json` and manage settings through the admin panel, or add configuration directly to your repository
- **Contributors**: Submit pull requests to add or update the configuration
