# How To Use Context7

Learn how to maximize Context7's capabilities with these practical guides.

## Adding a Project

You can add your favorite libraries and frameworks to Context7 to help developers get up-to-date documentation.

### Quick Method

The easiest way to add a library is through our web interface:

1. Visit [context7.com/add-library](https://context7.com/add-library?tab=github)
2. Provide the GitHub repository URL
3. Context7 will automatically parse and index the project's documentation

### Advanced Configuration

For more control over how Context7 parses your library, add a `context7.json` file to your repository root:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://context7.com/schema/context7.json",
  "projectTitle": "Your Library Name",
  "description": "Brief description of your library",
  "folders": ["docs", "guides"],
  "excludeFolders": ["src", "tests"],
  "excludeFiles": ["CHANGELOG.md"],
  "rules": ["Best practice or guideline here"],
  "previousVersions": [
    {
      "tag": "v1.0.0",
      "title": "version 1.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

See the [Library Owners](/library-owners) guide for detailed configuration options.

## Add Rule to Use Context7 in Your Agent

If you don't want to add `use context7` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule in your MCP client's rule section to auto-invoke Context7 on any code question.

### Where to Add Rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Windsurf" icon="wind">
    Add your rule to the `.windsurfrules` file in your project root.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cursor" icon="cursor">
    Go to `Cursor Settings` ’ `Rules` and add your rule there.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude Code" icon="code">
    Add your rule to the `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Rule

```txt
Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
```

<Note>
You can customize this rule to match your specific use cases and workflow preferences.
</Note>

## Using a Special Library ID

If you already know exactly which library you want to use, add its Context7 ID to your prompt. This allows Context7 MCP server to skip the library-matching step and directly retrieve documentation.

### How to Use Library IDs

Include the library ID in your prompt with the `/` prefix:

```txt
Implement basic authentication with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase for API and docs.
```

```txt
Create a rate limiter using Redis. use library /upstash/ratelimit for implementation.
```

```txt
Set up a Next.js API route with middleware. use library /vercel/next.js for documentation.
```

### Benefits

- **Faster responses**: Skips the library resolution step
- **Precise documentation**: Ensures you get docs for the exact library you need
- **Better context**: LLM knows exactly which library's conventions to follow

### Finding Library IDs

1. Search for your library on [context7.com](https://context7.com)
2. The library ID is shown in the URL and on the library page
3. Format: `/owner/repository` (e.g., `/mongodb/docs`, `/facebook/react`)

## Using HTTPS Proxy

If you are behind an HTTP proxy, Context7 uses the standard `https_proxy` / `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.

### Configuration

Set the environment variable before starting your MCP client:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Linux/macOS" icon="terminal">
    ```bash
    export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

    For authentication:
    ```bash
    export https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windows (Command Prompt)" icon="windows">
    ```cmd
    set https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

    For authentication:
    ```cmd
    set https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windows (PowerShell)" icon="windows">
    ```powershell
    $env:https_proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    ```

    For authentication:
    ```powershell
    $env:https_proxy = "http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MCP Configuration" icon="gear">
    You can also add proxy settings directly in your MCP configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "context7": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"],
          "env": {
            "https_proxy": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
            "HTTPS_PROXY": "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Both lowercase `https_proxy` and uppercase `HTTPS_PROXY` are supported. Context7 will check both.
