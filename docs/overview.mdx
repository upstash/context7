Context7 brings up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly into your AI coding assistant. No more outdated examples or hallucinated APIs.

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use. You get:

- ❌ Code examples are outdated and based on year-old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs that don't even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 fetches up-to-date code examples and documentation right into your LLM's context.

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt naturally
- 2️⃣ Tell the LLM to `use context7`
- 3️⃣ Get working code answers

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don't exist, no outdated code generation.
