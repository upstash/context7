Context7 brings up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples directly into your AI coding assistant. That means no more outdated code or hallucinated APIs.

## ❌ Without Context7

LLMs rely on outdated or generic information about the libraries you use:

- ❌ Code examples based on old training data
- ❌ Hallucinated APIs that don't even exist
- ❌ Generic answers for old package versions

## ✅ With Context7

Context7 MCP pulls up-to-date, version-specific documentation and code examples straight from the source — and places them directly into your prompt.

Add `use context7` to your prompt in Cursor:

```txt
Create a Next.js middleware that checks for a valid JWT in cookies and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`. use context7
```

```txt
Configure a Cloudflare Worker script to cache JSON API responses for five minutes. use context7
```

Context7 grounds your LLM with up-to-date documentation, ensuring that it always writes high quality code.

- 1️⃣ Write your prompt naturally
- 2️⃣ Add `use context7` to your prompt
- 3️⃣ Get working code with current APIs

No tab-switching, no hallucinated APIs that don't exist, no outdated code generation.
