![Library access options](/images/dashboard/library-access-selector.png)

**All Sources** (Default): Access to all public libraries, including future additions

**Select Specific**: Choose individual libraries or organizations

**Disable Public**: Private repos only (requires at least one private repo)

<Note>
Only owners and admins can change these settings.
</Note>

## Token Limits

Set maximum tokens per API request: **1,000 to 100,000** to limit the amount of documentation retrieved to prevent filling the context window of LLMs with too much documentation.

<Note>
For private repositories, see the [Private Repositories](/dashboard/private-repositories) page.
