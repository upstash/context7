## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's included in the Free plan?" icon="gift">
    The Free plan includes access to public repositories, basic access control, and API usage with rate limits. It's perfect for individual developers who don't need private repositories or team collaboration.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the Pro plan pricing work?" icon="credit-card">
  The Pro plan costs $7 per seat per month. Each team member counts as a seat, and you're billed based
  on the number of members in your team. You also pay for parse tokens used when adding or
  refreshing private repositories.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does parsing private libraries cost?" icon="dollar-sign">
  In addition to \$7 per seat per month, you are charged \$15 per 1M tokens for parsing private
  repositories. This charge applies when you add a new private repository or refresh an existing
  one. The cached pages (while refreshing private repositories) are free.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I access private repositories on the Free plan?" icon="lock">
    No, private repository access is only available on Pro and Enterprise plans. You'll need to upgrade to work with private repositories and collaborate with your team.
