## Understanding Costs

### Free Plan

The Free plan is always **$0**. Perfect for individual developers using public libraries.

### Pro Plan

Pro plan costs consist of two components:

**1. Team Seats: $7 per member per month**

Each team member (Owner, Admin, or Developer) counts as one seat. Learn more about team roles in the [Team Management](/dashboard/team#roles) guide.

**Example**:

- 1 member (you): $7/month
- 4 members: $28/month

**2. Parse Tokens: $15 per 1M tokens**

Parse tokens are charged when adding or refreshing private repositories:

- **Adding a new private repo**: Charged for all parsed content
- **Refreshing a repo**: Only charged for new or changed content (cached pages are free)
- **Querying documentation**: Free (covered by seat cost)

**Example**:

- Add a 500K token private repo: $7.50 one-time
- Refresh with 100K tokens of changes: $1.50

See [Private Repositories](/dashboard/private-repositories) for setup instructions and [Usage Statistics](/dashboard/usage) to monitor your token usage.

**Total Monthly Cost = (Seats × $7) + Parse Token Charges**

**Example**:

- Team: 4 members = $28/month
- Parsing: 800K tokens this month = $12
- **Total: $40**
