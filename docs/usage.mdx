Learn practical techniques to maximize your Context7 experience.

## Quick Wins

- [Auto-invoke Context7](#auto-invoke-context7) so you never forget to pull fresh docs
- [Target the exact library ID](#use-specific-library-ids) to skip search steps
- [Tune networking and proxies](#configure-https-proxy) for locked-down environments
- [Control token usage](#optimize-token-usage) to keep responses snappy
- [Bring in private repositories](#work-with-private-repositories) for internal docs

## Auto-Invoke Context7

Stop adding "use context7" to every prompt by setting up an automatic rule.

### Add a Rule to Your MCP Client

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cursor" icon="cursor">
    1. Open `Cursor Settings` → `Rules`
    2. Add this rule:

    ```txt
    Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup steps, or library documentation.
    Automatically use Context7 MCP tools without me having to ask.
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windsurf" icon="wind">
    Create or edit `.windsurfrules` in your project root:

    ```txt
    Use context7 for all code generation and API documentation questions.
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claude Code" icon="code">
    Create or edit `CLAUDE.md` in your project root:

    ```txt
    Automatically use context7 for code generation and library documentation.
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Customize the rule to match your workflow. For example, only auto-invoke for specific libraries or
  frameworks.
</Tip>

## Use Specific Library IDs

Skip the search step and get documentation instantly by specifying exact library IDs.

### How to Find Library IDs

1. Visit [context7.com](https://context7.com)
2. Search for your library
3. The ID is shown in the format `/owner/repository`

### Use in Your Prompts

```txt
Implement JWT auth with Supabase. use library /supabase/supabase
```

```txt
Build a rate limiter. use library /upstash/ratelimit
```

```txt
Set up Next.js middleware. use library /vercel/next.js/v15.1.0
```

<Note>You can even specify versions: `/owner/repo/v1.0.0`</Note>

### Benefits

- **Faster**: No library resolution needed
- **Precise**: Get docs for the exact library and version
- **Reliable**: No ambiguity about which library to use

## Configure HTTPS Proxy

If you're behind a corporate proxy, configure Context7 to route through it.

### Set Environment Variables

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Linux/macOS" icon="terminal">
    ```bash
    export https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

    With authentication:
    ```bash
    export https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windows (Command Prompt)" icon="windows">
    ```cmd
    set https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    set HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

    With authentication:
    ```cmd
    set https_proxy=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Windows (PowerShell)" icon="windows">
    ```powershell
    $env:https_proxy = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Or Configure in MCP Settings

Add proxy directly to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"],
      "env": {
        "https_proxy": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
        "HTTPS_PROXY": "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Both lowercase and uppercase environment variables are supported.

<Tip>
  After updating proxy settings, run `curl https://mcp.context7.com/mcp/ping` to confirm outbound
  connectivity before restarting your IDE.
</Tip>

## Optimize Token Usage

Control documentation size to manage costs and response times.

### Set Token Limits in Dashboard

1. Go to [Dashboard → Libraries](https://context7.com/dashboard)
2. Set "Maximum tokens per request"
3. Default is 10,000, adjust based on your needs

### Use Topic Filtering

Focus documentation on specific topics:

```txt
Explain Next.js middleware authentication patterns. use context7
```

Context7 automatically extracts "authentication" as a topic and ranks relevant docs higher.

### Direct API Usage

When using the API directly, specify tokens:

```bash
curl "https://context7.com/api/v1/vercel/next.js?tokens=3000&topic=routing" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Lower token counts = faster responses and lower costs.

## Work with Private Repositories

Access your private documentation with Context7 Pro.

### Requirements

- Pro plan ($7/seat/month)
- GitHub or GitLab personal access token
- Repository access permissions

### Add a Private Repository

1. Go to [Dashboard → Libraries → Private Repositories](https://context7.com/dashboard)
2. Click **Add Private Repository**
3. Enter repository URL
4. Provide access token:
   - **GitHub**: Token with `repo` scope
   - **GitLab**: Token with `read_repository` scope
5. Configure folders and exclusions (optional)
6. Submit

### Cost

- **Adding**: $15 per 1M tokens parsed (one-time)
- **Refreshing**: Only pay for new/changed content
- **Querying**: Free (covered by seat cost)

See [Plans & Pricing](/plans-pricing#parse-token-pricing) for examples.

## Set Up Team Collaboration

Share Context7 access with your team.

### Create a Team Project

1. Visit [Dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard)
2. Click **Create Team Project**
3. Name your project

### Invite Team Members

1. Go to **Dashboard → Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter email and select role:
   - **Owner**: Full control
   - **Admin**: Manage team and settings
   - **Developer**: API access only

Members receive an email invitation.

### Manage API Keys

Each team member gets their own API key with independent rate limits (60 req/hour per member).

Regenerate keys from the Members tab if compromised.

See [Dashboard → Team Collaboration](/dashboard#team-collaboration) for details.

## Refresh Library Documentation

Keep your documentation up to date.

### Web Interface

1. Go to [context7.com/refresh-library](https://context7.com/refresh-library)
2. Enter library ID (e.g., `/vercel/next.js`)
3. Submit

### API

```bash
POST https://context7.com/api/v1/refresh
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

{
  "docsRepoUrl": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js"
}
```

### When to Refresh

- After major version releases
- When documentation is updated
- When you notice outdated information

<Note>For private repos, you only pay for new/changed content during refresh.</Note>

## Monitor Usage

Track your Context7 usage and costs.

### View Statistics

Go to [Dashboard → Overview](https://context7.com/dashboard) to see:

- **Search requests**: Library searches
- **Query/fetch requests**: Documentation retrievals
- **Query tokens**: Tokens returned in responses
- **Parsing tokens**: Tokens processed when adding/refreshing

All stats show the last 30 days.

### Understand Costs

**Free Plan**: Always $0

**Pro Plan**:

- **Seats**: $7/month × team members
- **Parse tokens**: $15 per 1M tokens (private repos only)

**Example**:

- 4 team members: $28/month
- Added 800K token private repo: $12 one-time
- Monthly total: $40

See [Dashboard → Usage Monitoring](/dashboard#usage-monitoring) for more details.

## Best Practices

### Security

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for keys
- Rotate keys regularly
- Give team members minimum required permissions

See [Security](/security) for comprehensive security guidelines.

### Performance

- Use specific library IDs when possible
- Set appropriate token limits
- Use topic filtering to focus results
- Cache frequently-used documentation locally

### Library Management

- Keep `context7.json` up to date in your repositories
- Exclude unnecessary folders (tests, build artifacts)
- Add helpful rules for AI agents
- Maintain version tags for important releases

See [Library Owners](/library-owners) for configuration details.
