description: Using Context7 with Cursor
---

Context7 brings up-to-date library documentation directly into Cursor. Instead of getting outdated code examples from training data, you get current documentation from source repositories.

## Installation

### One-Click Install

Since Cursor 1.0, you can install Context7 with a single click:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Remote Server" icon="cloud">
    [![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=context7&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5jb250ZXh0Ny5jb20vbWNwIn0%3D)

    Connects to Context7's hosted server. No local installation needed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Server" icon="computer">
    [![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=context7&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEB1cHN0YXNoL2NvbnRleHQ3LW1jcCJ9)

    Runs the MCP server on your machine via npx.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Manual Installation

Add this to your Cursor MCP config file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Remote Server" icon="cloud">
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "context7": {
          "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    Simpler setup, no local dependencies.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local Server" icon="computer">
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "context7": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    Runs on your machine, requires Node.js.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Project-Level Configuration

You can also configure Context7 for a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. This is useful when:

- Different projects need different API keys
- You want to share the config with your team via version control
- A project requires specific Context7 settings

The project config uses the same format as the global config.

<Note>
Context7 works without an API key for basic usage. Adding an API key gives you higher rate limits, access to private repositories, and team usage tracking. Get one at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).
</Note>

## Setting Up Rules

To make Context7 trigger automatically (without typing "use context7" every time), add a rule in Cursor.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cursor Settings" icon="settings">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Settings">
        Go to `Settings` → `Cursor Settings` → `Rules`
      </Step>
      <Step title="Add the Rule">
        ```
        Always use Context7 MCP when I ask about library documentation, API references, or need code examples from external packages.
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title=".cursorrules File" icon="file">
    Create a `.cursorrules` file in your project root:

    ```
    # Context7 Integration

    When the user asks about:
    - Library APIs or documentation
    - Framework setup or configuration
    - Code examples for external packages
    - How to use a specific library feature

    Automatically use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation. Don't rely on training data for library-specific code.
    ```

    This makes Context7 part of your project's standard workflow and can be version-controlled.
  </Tab>

## Using Context7

### Basic Usage

Just ask about any library and Context7 will fetch the docs:

```
How do I set up middleware in Next.js 15?
Show me Prisma query examples for relations
What's the Supabase syntax for row-level security?
```

### Using Library IDs Directly

If you already know the Context7 library ID, include it in your prompt to skip the resolution step:

```
Implement authentication using /supabase/supabase for the API docs.
Set up routing with /vercel/next.js for reference.
```

The slash prefix tells Context7 to use that library directly.

### Version Pinning

When you're working with a specific version, mention it in your prompt:

```
How do I set up Next.js 14 middleware?
Show me React 18 Suspense examples
```

Context7 matches the appropriate version automatically.

For exact version control, use the full version ID:

```
Use /vercel/next.js/v15.1.8 for the middleware docs.
Reference /facebook/react/v19.0.0 for the new hooks.
```

### Example Prompts That Work Well

```
I'm setting up a new Next.js 15 project. How do I configure the app router for API routes?

I need to add Supabase auth to my React app. Show me the client-side setup.

What's the correct way to define Prisma relations for a user with many posts?

How do I use Tailwind's new container queries?
```

## Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project vs Global Config">
    Use **global config** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) when:
    - You want Context7 available in all projects
    - You're using a personal API key

    Use **project config** (`.cursor/mcp.json`) when:
    - The project has specific Context7 requirements
    - You want to share the setup with teammates
    - Different projects need different API keys
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combining with Cursor Composer">
    Context7 works well with Cursor's Composer feature. When you're building something that involves external libraries:

    1. Start with a prompt that mentions the libraries you need
    2. Context7 fetches the relevant docs
    3. Composer uses those docs to generate accurate code

    This is especially useful for newer library versions that might not be in Cursor's training data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Getting Better Results">
    - Be specific about what you're trying to do, not just which library
    - Mention versions when they matter
    - If the first result isn't right, ask for a different part of the docs

    ```
    # Good
    How do I handle file uploads with the Supabase Storage API?

    # Less specific
    How does Supabase storage work?
