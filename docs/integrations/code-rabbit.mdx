[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) is an AI-powered code review tool that automatically reviews pull requests. By connecting Context7 as an MCP server, CodeRabbit can access up-to-date library documentation during reviews, helping it verify implementations against the latest API references and best practices.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to MCP Servers">
    Go to your [CodeRabbit dashboard](https://app.coderabbit.ai) and navigate to **Integrations** → **MCP Servers**.

    ![Integrations tab](/images/integrations/coderabbit/integrations-tab.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Context7">
    Click the **Add** button next to **Context7** MCP server.

    Add the following header for higher rate limits:

    | Header | Value |
    |--------|-------|
    | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` | Your API key from the [Context7 dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) |

    ```json
    {
      "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Click the **Connect** button to connect the server.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable for Public Repos">
    To use Context7 with public repositories, go to **Organization Settings** → **Configuration** → **Knowledge Base**. In the MCP section, select **Enabled** instead of **Auto** and click **Apply Changes**.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage Guidance

In the **Usage Guidance** field, you can instruct CodeRabbit on how to use Context7 during reviews. For example:

```
Use Context7 to look up documentation for any libraries used in the code being reviewed.
Verify that API usage matches the latest documentation and flag any deprecated patterns.
```

## How It Works

Once connected, CodeRabbit will query Context7 for relevant library documentation when reviewing pull requests. This helps CodeRabbit:

- Verify correct API usage against the latest documentation
- Identify deprecated methods or patterns
- Suggest improvements based on library best practices
- Provide more accurate and informed review comments
