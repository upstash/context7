[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) is an AI-powered code review tool that automatically reviews pull requests. By connecting Context7 as an MCP server, CodeRabbit can access up-to-date library documentation during reviews, helping it verify implementations against the latest API references and best practices.

## Setup

1. Go to your [CodeRabbit dashboard](https://app.coderabbit.ai)
2. Navigate to **Integrations** → **MCP Servers**
3. Click **Add new MCP server** and select **Custom Server**
4. Configure the server with:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `context7` |
| URL | `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp` |

5. Add the following header for authentication:

| Header | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` | Your API key from the [Context7 dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) |

6. Save the configuration

## Usage Guidance

In the **Usage Guidance** field, you can instruct CodeRabbit on how to use Context7 during reviews. For example:

```
Use Context7 to look up documentation for any libraries used in the code being reviewed.
Verify that API usage matches the latest documentation and flag any deprecated patterns.
```

## How It Works

Once connected, CodeRabbit will query Context7 for relevant library documentation when reviewing pull requests. This helps CodeRabbit:

- Verify correct API usage against the latest documentation
- Identify deprecated methods or patterns
- Suggest improvements based on library best practices
- Provide more accurate and informed review comments
